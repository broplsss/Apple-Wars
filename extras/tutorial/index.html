<h1 style="margin-top: 50px;">Basics</h1>
  
  <h2>With Mouse</h2>

    <p>Look around with your mouse.</p>
    <p>Hold down to move towards your pointer.</p>
    <p>Shoot with the F key, and leave a game with A.</p>
  
  <h2>On Touchscreen</h2>

    <p>Hold down to change direction and move towards your pointer.</p>
    <p>Shoot with the <img src="/sprites/shootButton.png" alt="shoot">

<h1>Gameplay</h1>
  
  <h2>Poison</h2>

    <p>Some bullets can poison the enemy, such as cherry pits.</p>
    <p>When poisoned, you take a decreasing amount of damage until the effect wears off.</p>

  <h2>Explosives</h2>

    <p>Some bullets explode on impact, including the pear missile.</p>
    <p>When something explodes, it deals extra damage to surrounding apples, and to the main target.</p>

  <h2>Splitting</h2>

    <p>A few bullets split into more bullets on impact, like the raspberry.</p>
    <p>The fragments go off in all directions, and always do less damage than whatever they came from.</p>
    <p>When a watermelon splits, the watermelon slices that come from it also split on impact.</p>

  <h2>Winning</h2>

    <p>One full game takes about one and a half minutes, with the enemies spawning faster and faster as you get closer to the end.</p>
    <p>The last 20 seconds stop increasing in difficulty. Bosses don't spawn, but there are over five new enemies every second.</p>



  
  
<h1>Shopping</h1>
  
  <h2>Bullets</h2>

    <p>If the box under the icon is gray and has a price on it, you haven't bought it yet.</p>
    <p>If the item has the unknown icon (gray apple with a ?), then you have to buy something else to reveal this bullet.</p>
    <p>Once bought, the bullet will either have a button saying EQUIP or EQUIPPED. Equipped means this is the bullet you're currently using.</p>

  <h2>Upgrades</h2>

    <p>The green bar behind the price - if any - represents how many levels of the upgrade you bought.</p>
    <p>The upgrades do all sorts of things, from increasing damage to giving you poison resistance.</p>






<h1>Options</h1>
  
  <h2>Settings</h2>

    <p>All of the settings are pretty self explanitory. Change them by clicking the switch button.</p>

  <h2>Wipe Save</h2>

    <p>Clicking this will send you to a confirmation screen.</p>
    <p>If you click the apple fast enough your progress will be destroyed... surprise!</p>
